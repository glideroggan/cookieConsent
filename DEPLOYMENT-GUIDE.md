### üåê GitHub Pages Setup

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** (if not already done):
   - Go to your repository Settings
   - Scroll to "Pages" section
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Your workflow file is already in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

2. **Your Demo URL will be**:
   ```
   https://glideroggan.github.io/cookieConsent/
   ```

3. **Automatic Deployment**:
   - Every push to `main` branch automatically deploys
   - Changes typically appear within 1-2 minutes
   - Uses the `/docs` folder as the source

### üîó Connect Your API

When you're ready to connect your hosted .NET API:

1. **Update the API URL** in `docs/index.html`:
   ```html
   <!-- Change this line -->
   <cookie-consent api-url="https://your-api-server.com/api" cookie-name="demo-consent"></cookie-consent>
   
   <!-- To your actual API URL -->
   <cookie-consent api-url="https://yourdomain.com/api" cookie-name="demo-consent"></cookie-consent>
   ```

2. **Configure CORS** in your .NET API:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
   {
       options.AddPolicy("AllowGitHubPages", builder =>
           builder.WithOrigins("https://glideroggan.github.io")
                  .AllowAnyMethod()
                  .AllowAnyHeader());
   });
   ```

3. **Test the connection**:
   - Deploy your API
